# Chromavox

Optical synthesizer. Audio input drives a row of light emitters on the left
wall; an additive synth plays back what arrives at sensors on the right wall.
Placeable prisms, lenses, mirrors, colored glass, and dichroic mirrors between
them reshape the pitch mapping, timbre, and routing of the sound. Underneath
is a real 2D optics simulation — Snell refraction, Sellmeier (or Cauchy)
wavelength-dependent index, Beer-Lambert absorption, dichroic reflectance.
Plain HTML + ES modules + WebGL2, no dependencies.

## Run

```
npm start          # node serve.js, port 8005
node serve.js 9000 # override port
```

ES modules require HTTP (not `file://`). Server ROOT is `docs/`, which is
also the GitHub Pages folder.

## Architecture docs

Detailed notes are split into topic files under `agent_docs/`:

- [Overview & module layout](agent_docs/architecture-overview.md)
- [Ray tracer](agent_docs/architecture-raytracer.md)
- [Materials](agent_docs/architecture-materials.md)
- [Elements](agent_docs/architecture-elements.md)
- [Audio in / out](agent_docs/architecture-audio.md)
- [UI & state](agent_docs/architecture-ui.md)
- [Known gotchas](agent_docs/architecture-gotchas.md)

## Key invariants to remember

- Coordinates are bench pixels; y is **down**. Polygon winding and
  outward-normal sign in `worldEdges` depend on it.
- Tracer never branches rays (no Fresnel split). TIR reflects; dichroic
  mirror absorbs the non-reflected fraction. Keeps the vertex buffer
  size predictable.
- Equilateral prism requires `n < 2` for any transmission. `diamond`
  always TIRs; `hyper` is tuned to satisfy the bound.
- Undo/redo batches via `beginEdit` / `endEdit`; drags and slider scrubs
  collapse into one history entry.
- Scene JSON is `version: 1`. IDs are regenerated on deserialize;
  `bumpIdCeiling` keeps the running counter ahead of any restored max.
